> This is a simple fullstack app that was built with ReactJS for the frontend and Ruby On Rails for the backend. This app is a mobile web app that contains listings of houses, apartments, rooms etc. On the Home page, when you first visit the app, you can see a short description of the app. Through there you can either sign in or sign up to access the listings. When logged in, the Home page shows all of the listings, from there you can access the Listing Details page or the Favourites page. In the Listing Details page you can see the full details for that house. From the Details page you can also add that particular listing to your list of Favourites, or remove it.
